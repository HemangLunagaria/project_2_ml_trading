# Project 2: The T-1000 Tradinator

## Overview

The T-1000 Tradinator is a sophisticated Machine Learning Algoritmic Trading Bot, sent back through time to help crypto humans successfully trade.

We decided to create an Algorithmic trading bot that users can interact with through Amazon Lex as send messages through slack and telegram. The bot will then gather the data on the crypto currency previously specifided by the users. Then use technical analysis indicators to prepare thhe data. The bot will then use these signals to run multiple Machine Learning models and compare the results of these models to determine the most accurate Buy/Sell/Hold signal for the user. 

Using Amazon Lex, the bot will then be instructed to either execute a Buy or Sell trade in a live trading account or do nothing by holding the position.
